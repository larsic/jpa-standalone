    <!--
        By merely mentioning this table without giving it any values, dbunit knows that
        it should first delete all passenger_emails and then the passengers, because otherwise
        deleting a passenger would potentially leave an existing reference to passenger inside passenger_emails.

        Note that this does not have anything to do with Hibernate, but is due to the fact that we
        need to clear and restore the database before every run of the unit tests, to avoid the dreaded "ordered tests"
        problem (this problem does tend to show up in a database based test, because there you actually use a
        shared persistent memory which would be remembered across tests unless we take explicit action this way.

        Also note that other solutions exist to this problem (being rollback after every test for instance), but each
        solution always has it's own share of problems, so it's hard to fnd a 'universally superior' solution.

    <!--
        A better idea would be to actually add some records for the passenger here, so you can use it in a unit test
        which kills two birds in one stone (possibiloty of using in unit tests and fixing this problem we had).
